                The new season in the Swiss Football League will kick off Saturday evening. The window is still open and therefore more ins and outs are to be expected. Clubs like the champion Berne will almost surely loose some of last seasons star ensemlbe to big name clubs in Europe. But how did your team do so far on the transfer market? Here are our five takeaways from this summers transfer window:

                <p class="body-text sub-font">
                We looked at each transfer individually and checked how many professional game that player played in his career. Then we calculated the difference of total game minutes played between the ins and outs. The verdict: All clubs lost game experience during the summer.

                All the clubs got rid of or lost some experienced players this summer. The gaps in the lineup were filled with younger and less experienced players. The data shows: There's a youth movement going on.

                <p class="body-text sub-font">
                In order to make up for the loss of goal scoring some teams opened up their wallets and brought in some expensive strikers with a high market value. But a closer look at the player data suggests that it is not always "the more expensive the better" when it comes to soccer players. One fact becomes obvious when looking at their goal ratio compared to their market value: Some of them are grossly overpaid.

                <p class="body-text sub-font">
                Soccer stars are some the highest-paid athletes in Switzerland, and their agents are basically free to charge whatever commission they want (the standard is around 10%). Some of the agents that brokered most of the deals this summer have been able to build sprawling practices, representing players not only in Switzerland but across multiple leagues, most notably England's Premier League, La Liga of Spain and Germany's Bundesliga. Here are the biggest names in the business:

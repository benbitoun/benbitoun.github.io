                At a time when the Middle East, North Korea and China dominate the agenda of US foreign-policy, Latin America hasn’t received much attention – other than in the nativist overtones of current immigration debates and the talk about trade wars. These are the Latin American countries that bought U.S weapon systems in 2017:

                In contrast, five of the ten biggest buyers of US arms were countries in the Middle East. The the top buyer Saudi Arabia bought US weapons worth 38 billion TIV - and this only in 2017.
                <br>
                <br>
                By looking at these export numbers it becomes clear that, after being a sideshow until 1979, the Middle East has become what Latin America was before: the US "backyard". A geopolitical hotspot where the US is trying to extert influence on political developments through supporting one regime over the other, through political pressure or through regime changes.
                <br>
                <br>
                The application of the Monroe doctrine meant that for decades Latin American citizens would de facto live under the control of the United States. According to the historian John Coatsworth, the U.S brought down 41 Latin American governments between 1898 and 1994 - directly. And then they also backed anti-communist Rulers such as the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and helped them come to power. later, in the 1990s, the US shifted towards actively supporting highly contested neoliberal regimes and started to form military-anti-drug related alliances.
                <br>
                <br>
                To this date, high ranked U.S politicians involved in U.S missions and interventions in Latin America, such as former Secretary Henry Kissinger, were acquitted of any charges with the Courts ruling that all they did was to protect national interests. In order to see how they did that let's find out if there is a correlation between US weapon export, regime changes and other historical events in Latin America by looking at the arms export data since the 1950s, gathered by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute <a href="https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers">(SIPRI).</a>

                Compared to the export numbers for 2017 there are changes. Over the last 67 years it is Brazil that's the top buyer of US arms, followed by Argentina, Colombia and Chile. Let's focus on these four countries and have a closer look at what exactly it was that they bought from the US arms manufacturers.

                Looking at the totals does offer insight about the balance of power on the continent and about the arms races that were going on between rival states like Brazil and Argentina. But it also gives us an understanding why the SIPRI felt the need to create the trade-indicator value: because one surveillance aircraft doesn't have the military importance of a fighter jet and a tug boat doesn't have the same value as a submarine. Therefore the total numbers don't tell the whole story.

                <br>
                Also, they don't tell us exactly what was going on. In order to link the US weapon exports to the historic events we have to zoom in on the year and have a look at the numbers and at what exactly happened back then.

                The U.S government declassified ten thousands of documents on their 20th century foreign policy in Latin America. They can be found in the Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) series. The <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments">series</a> presents the official documentary historical record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions and significant diplomatic activity. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Also declassified are the memos, telegrams and conversations between then-Secretary Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon, several members of the National Security Counsel and dicator Augusto Pinochet. The <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB437/">documents</a> provide insight on how close the United States worked together with the authoritarian Regime in Chile.
                <br>
                <br>
                And last but not least, the National Security Archive at the George Washington University did what was called the <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/news/20001113/">Chile Documentation Project</a>. 16'000 Secret U.S Documents were declassified. The declassification includes 700 controversial CIA documents that the Directorate of Operations had refused to release—records of U.S. covert operations between 1968 and 1975 to destabilize the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende and, after the violent 1973 coup, to bolster the military regime of Augusto Pinochet.
